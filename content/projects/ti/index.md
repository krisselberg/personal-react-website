description: "Production website built with React"
---

This project is a website built for a college organization I am a part of, The Tiger Inn. Using [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/), I was able to improve the overall performance of the website by 22%. This performance boost was achieved by using srcset to load different image sizes for various screen widths, using react-router-dom to navigate quickly between pages, and removing unused CSS. The website was designed using React and uses embedded Google Drive elements to allow for automatic updates to the site without changing any code. I also filmed and edited the drone video on the home page.

The website can be viewed [here](https://www.tigerinn.net) and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/krisselberg/react-ti-website).
