Newport does a great job of linking together all of the scientific research of what makes a "good career", compelling narratives of people successful in having a great career, and detailing "rules" you can implement to have a good career yourself. At first, I immediately disagreed with his radical advice of "don't follow your passion", but after reading the book I am convinced that he is right. I had been going down the wrong path trying to figure out my one dream job/career until Newport put me back on the right one with this book. Every person on Earth should read this book.

Notes:

"The key thing is to force yourself through the work, force the skills to come; that's the hardest phase. I feel like your problem is that you're trying to judge all things in the abstract before you do them. That's your tragic mistake." - public radio host Ira Glass

"I didn't go out with the idea of making a big empire. I set goals for myself at being the best I could be at what[ever] I did." - founder of Channel Island Surfboards Al Merrick

Compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion.

Career passions are rare, passion takes time, and passion is a side effect of mastery.

The passion hypothesis convinces people that somewhere there's a magic 'right' job waiting for them, and that if they find it, they'll immediately recognize that this is the work they were meant to do. The problem, of course, is when they fail to find this certainty, bad things follow, such as chronic job-hopping and crippling self-doubt.

The passion hypothesis is not just wrong, it's also dangerous. For most people, 'follow your passion' is bad advice.

"Nobody ever takes note of [my advice], because it's not the answer they wanted to hear. What they want to hear is 'Here's how you get an agent, here's how you write a script,' ... but I always say, 'Be so good they can't ignore you'. If somebody's thinking, 'How can I be really good?' people are going to come to you." - actor and comedian Steve Martin

The deep questions driving the passion mindset - 'Who am I?' and 'What do I truly love?' - are essentially impossible to confirm. 'Is this who I really am?' and 'Do I love this?' rarely reduce to clear yes-or-no responses. In other words, the passion mindset is almost guaranteed to keep you perpetually unhappy and confused.

Instead of adopting the passion mindset, which focuses on what the world can offer you, adopt the craftsman mindset, which focuses on what you can offer the world.

Put aside the question of whether your job is your true passion, and instead turn your focus toward becoming so good they can't ignore you. That is, regardless of what you do for a living, approach your work like a true performer.

The Career Capital Theory of Great Work

The traits that define great work are rare and valuable
Supply and demand says that if you want these traits you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. This of these rare and valuable skills you can offer as your career capital.
The craftsman mindset, with its relentless focus on becoming 'so good they can't ignore you,' is a strategy well suited for acquiring career capital. This is why it trumps the passion mindset if your goal is to create work you love.
You need to get good in order to get good things in your working life, and the craftsman mindset is focused on achieving exactly this goal.

Certain jobs are better suited for applying career capital theory than others. If your job satisfies any of these disqualifiers, it might be better to find another job.

Three Disqualifiers for Applying the Craftsman Mindset

The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by deveeloping relevant skills that are rare and valuable
The job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world
The job forces you to work with people you really dislike
If you just show up and work hard, you'll soon hit a performance plateau beyond which you fail to get any better. Deliberate practice might provide the key to quickly becoming so good they can't ignore you.

Anders Ericsson describes the traits crucial for deliberate practice as:

stretching your abilities by taking on project beyond your current comfort zone
obsessively seek out feedback on everything
This will allow you to acquire career capital.

The Five Habits of a Craftsman

Decide What Capital Market You're In
Winner-take-all market: only one type of career capital available and lots of different people are competing for it.
Ex. television writing because all that matters is your ability to write good scripts, blogging because all that matters is whether or not your posts compel the reader
Auction market: there are many types of career capital, and each person might generate a unique collection.
Ex. The cleantech space
Identify your capital type
If you are in a winner-take-all market, this is trivial. By definition there is one type of capital that matters.
If you are in an auction market, seek open gates, opportunities to build valuable capital that are already open to you
Ex. leveraging an Ivy League education to work with professors on impactful research
Define "Good"
Deliberate practice requires good goals. If you don't know where you're trying to get to, then it's hard to take effective action.
Stretch and Destroy
Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that's exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands.... Deliberate practice is above all an effort of focus and concentration. That is what makes it 'deliberate,' as distinct from the mindless playing of scales or hitting of tennis balls that most people engage in.
Deliberate practice is often the opposite of enjoyable. If you're not uncomfortable, then you're probably stuck at an 'acceptable level'
Pushing past what's comfortable, however, is only one part of the deliberate-practice story; the other part is embracing honest feedback - even if it destroys what you thought was good
It's so tempting to just assume what you've done is good enough and check it off your to-do list, but it's in honest, sometimes harsh feedback that you learn where to retrain your focus in order to continue to make progress.
Be patient
Without a patient willingness to reject shiny new pursuits, you'll derail your efforts before you acquire the capital you need
You stretch yourself, day after day, month after month, before finally looking up and realizing, 'Hey, I've become pretty good, and people are starting to notice'
Control is the "dream-job elixir" because it is one of the most universally important traits that you can acquire with your career capital. Decades of scientific research have identified this trait as one of the most important you can pursue in the quest for a happier, more successful, and more meaningful life.

Giving people more control over what they do and how they do it increases their happiness, engagement, and sense of fulfillment. If your goal is to love what you do, your first step is to acquire career capital. Your next step is to invest this capital in the traits that define great work. Control is one of the most important targets you can choose for this investment.

The Two Control Traps

Control that's acquired without career capital is not sustainable
The point at which you have acquired enough career capital to get meaningful control over your working life is exactly the point when you've become valuable enough to your current employer that they will try to prevent you from making the change
In most jobs you should expect your employer to resist your move toward more control; they have every incentive to try to convince you to reinvest your career capital back into your career at their company, obtaining more money and prestige instead of more control, and this can be a hard argument to resist
How to avoid the control traps? Simple answer: Do what people are willing to pay you for. This is different from pursuing money for the sake of having money. Money is a neutral indicator of value. By aiming to make money, you're aiming to be valuable. Hobbies are clearly exempt from this rule. But when it comes to decisions affecting your core career, money remains an effective judge of value.

The Law of Financial Viability: When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on.

In addition to control, having a unifying mission to your working life can be a source of great satisfaction.

Missions are powerful because they focus your energy toward a useful goal, and this in turn maximizes your impact on your world - a crucial factor in loving what you do.

Hardness scares off the daydreamers and the timid, leaving more opportunity for those like us who are willing to take the time to carefully work out the best path forward and then confidently take action.

A mission chosen before you have relevant career capital is not likely to be sustainable.

A good career mission is similar to a scientific breakthrough - it's an innovation waiting to be discovered in the adjacent possible (cutting edge) of your field. If you want to identify a mission for you working life, therefore, you must first get to the cutting edge - the only place where these missions become visible.

If life-transforming missions could be found with just a little navel-gazing and an optimistic attitude, changing the world would be commonplace. But it's not commonplace; it's instead quite rare.

"I think you do need passion to be happy. It's just that we don't know what that passion is. If you ask someone, they'll tell you what they think they're passionate about, but they probably have it wrong." - Pardis Sabeti, Harvard infectious disease researcher. In other words, she believe that having a passion for your work is vital, but she also believes that it's a fool's errand to try to figure out in advance what work will lead to this passion.

Great missions are transformed into great successes as the result of using small and achievable projects - little bets - to explore the concrete possibilities surrounding a compelling idea.

Many people have lots of career capital, and can therefore identify a variety of different potential missions for their work, but few actually build their career around such missions.

After interviewing successful innovators and innovative companies, Peter Sims found, "Rather than believing they have to start with a big idea or plan out a whole project in advance, they make a methodical series of little bets about what might be a good direction, learning critical infromation from lots of little failures and from small but significant wins." This rapid and frequent feedback "allows them to find unexpected avenues and arrive at extraordinary outcomes".

The important thing about little bets is that they're bite-sized. You try one. It takes a few months at most. It either succeeds or fails, but either way you get important feedback to guide your next steps. This approach stands in contrast to the idea of choosing a bold plan and making one big bet on its success.

Great missions are transformed into great successes as the result of finding projects that satisfy the law of remarkability (an idea inspires people to remark about it, and it is launched in a venue where remarking is made easy).
