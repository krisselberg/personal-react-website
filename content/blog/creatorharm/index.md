The Social Dilemma documentary on Netflix has gotten me to second guess my decision to pursue content creation as a career. The documentary highlights how social media uses algorithms to make small behavior changes in humans that add up over time. As I was watching the film, I thought about how this applies to my work as a content creator on Tiktok and YouTube. Am I contributing towards the mass behavior change of humans across the world?

## Do creators stop people from living more meaningful lives?

This scares me. By creating on social media, are creators essentially dragging people away from living life to its greatest potential for advertisers to profit off of them? In today's attention economy, people are the products. As creators, we are doing the hard part of creating a product that is willing to spend their time and money in a certain way. We are slowly, day-by-day influencing and shaping the minds of people that watch our content whether we like it or not. If your content is popular in any way on a social media platform, that means you are good at keeping people engrossed in your content. This benefits the technology and advertisers behind the screen that need the attention of the consumers.

**My answer to this: create content that does less harm than good.**

Right now, there is no way to create content that does no harm at all. Due to the way that the algorithms on these social platforms are developed, it favors content that keeps people on its respective platforms. My job as a creator is to enhance people's lives more than I am hurting them. By keeping people glued to their screens, but by providing them with true and educational content that will allow them to live better lives off screen, I will have done my job the best I can. The tools available to content creators currently favor the financial incentive of profiting off consumers. The mental health of the "users" is almost never prioritized. Even when Tiktok says "Whoa, you have been scrolling for way too long. Take a break!", they are masking the fact that their algorithm exists for the sole purpose of keeping users on the app for as long as possible.

I hope to make content that inspires people to stop being "users" and start living life to its fullest. Of course, this is damaging for my own well-being and misaligned with my financial incentives. However, if my platform's content can inspire people to consume less and live more, I will be more than happy to lose some of my "subscribers" or "followers".
