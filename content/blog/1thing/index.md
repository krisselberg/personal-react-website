There have been periods of days where I ask myself, "Why am I unhappy?" I try listing out different things that could be causing my unhappiness. However, there is one thing that usually comes alongside a blip of temporary sadness that I cannot explain.

9 times out of 10, I have not worked out once in the past three days. Working out first thing in the morning has led to a ripple effect of benefits in my life:

- **[Increased alertness throughout the day](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/exercising-for-better-sleep#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20effect%20of%20exercise%20in,decline%20helps%20to%20facilitate%20sleepiness.)**
- **[Improved mood](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26917992/)**
- **[Better sleep](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25596964/)**

I am an early bird, so working out in the morning makes sense for me. I have also found that it elevates the rest of my day. Even if you classify yourself as a night owl, I encourage everyone to try working out in the morning to improve the rest of their day.

> "The harder the workout, the easier the day" - Naval Ravikant

Naval Ravikant, co-founder and chairman of AngelList, has emphasized that his daily morning workout is the habit that has most positively impacted his life. I have found myself dodging good habits in the past with excuses, the most common being "I don't have time". By making my physical health my number one priority in life, I have been able to avoid these excuses when it comes to working out in the morning. I have found it especially hard in college to prioritize physical health, writing, and mental health due to the countless distractions. However, by putting these priorities over others (going out to dinner with friends, watching a football game, etc.), I am able to be happier and more fulfilled in my life.

By making working out first thing in the morning a priority for me, I have been able to perform better in other aspects of my life. My grades are better, I am more confident, and my mind is more clear when I have a daily habit of working out in the morning.

Working out in the morning is like walking around with a secret. If I stumble on the stairs to class, answer a question wrong, or get a bad grade on an assignment, at least I started the day off with a workout. Try it and let me know what you think!
