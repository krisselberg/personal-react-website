Who would want to do this to themselves? Well, David Goggins has recruited tens of thousands of people, including myself, to do this challenge since it was publicized in his autobiography, Can’t Hurt Me.

Who is David Goggins? David Goggins is a former Navy SEAL that previously held the world record for the most amount of pull-ups in 24 hours with 4,030 pull-ups. Last year, at 45 years old, Goggins ran the MOAB 240 ultramarathon placing second in the 241 mile event. So, David Goggins is kind of a badass.

In the challenge that he calls the “4 x 4 x 48” challenge, Goggins advocates for persevering through all obstacles and completing the challenge with no excuses. Goggins explains in a video to his viewers, “If you can’t run four miles, walk; if you can’t walk, ride your bike; if you can’t ride your bike, do some pushups, some sit-ups, some calisthenics”.

So why would anyone want to do this to themselves? After reading Goggins’ autobiography, I could not wait to do the challenge. I had never ran more than 7 miles at once before doing the challenge, and I thoroughly recommend training in advance if you decide to do this challenge for yourself. These were my 3 main personal reasons for attempting to complete the challenge:

- **To stop procrastinating on assignments and schoolwork**

How can waking up at irregular hours and running help with procrastination? The ability to overcome mental barriers and force myself to do something that I would rather put off will be strengthened by completing this challenge. This will help me with overcoming the mental hurdles that I experience with procrastination.

- **To stretch my comfort zone and see how far my mind can take me**

David Goggins has a rule called the “40% rule” which states that when the mind and body tire up, we are only at 40% of our true potential. I wanted to put this rule up to the test.

- **To add a story to my cookie jar**

For me, a central aspect of life is about creating great memories and stories with the people around me. I attempt to continuously add to my “cookie jar” as life goes on by seeking out new experiences.

At the first glimpse of January 28, we somehow managed to gather together seven tough, driven friends to take on this behemoth of a challenge. I was extremely surprised by the willingness of people that I had just met to do this challenge with me. I have made some of my closest friends through attempting this challenge with people I had just met a few days before. I am grateful for the bonds that going through a physical and mental struggle together formed with my friends.

The main struggles throughout the challenge were sleep deprivation and physical deterioration. As someone who can barely function on 6 hours of sleep, I had to persevere on a maximum of 3–4 hours for each day. I ran the first 24 miles and had ample time to get a good four hours of sleep in between sets on the first day. However, on my second midnight run, my ankle started giving out while “running” at around a 13-minute mile pace. By taking Goggins’ advice, I was able to do the next two sets of 4 miles walking.

Walking has a couple of benefits and disadvantages during this challenge. By walking, I was able to keep going in the challenge without risking further injury. On the other hand, I would only have around 2 hours of rest in between sets leaving a tough decision between showering or getting one good sleep cycle in before my next run.

During my 30th mile, I had great doubts about my ability to finish the challenge. To spare the details, I will just say that I was very close to being unable to control my bowels. After finishing my 32nd mile, I decided to transition to riding a bike. Looking back, this decision to continue may have been poor for my physical health, but I still do not regret it. The experience of being able to push my mental barriers to their limit was priceless.

I biked until the last 4 miles, where I ran on the track with the remaining 2/6 friends that persevered until the end of the challenge. On mile 42, a golf ball-sized blister forming on the underside of my foot popped, forcing me to limp the last two miles. Despite the excruciating pain and exhaustion I was feeling at the finish line, I was in a state of absolute bliss.

Reflecting on the experience, I am very happy that I was able to be surrounded by such inspiring individuals in such a humbling challenge.

I have a newfound greater appreciation of the mind’s ability to consciously persevere through obstacles to achieving a goal. Recently, I have noticed myself thinking back to the challenge when I am procrastinating on an assignment or pressing the snooze button and instead using my willpower to overcome hurdles and wake up early or start an essay a couple days in advance.

I definitely appreciate the beauty of sleeping more, and how not getting enough sleep can take a real toll on the mind and body. I do not think I have ever been as tired as I was when I had to wake up for the second 4 AM run on 1 hour of sleep.

If you are thinking of doing the challenge, please make sure to take the proper safety precautions, prepare, and never run/walk/bike alone if you are not feeling well. Drink lots of fluids, eat foods high in carbohydrates, and wear sunscreen!

When done safely, the 4x4x48 challenge can have a profound impact on anyone’s life and mind, and I recommend it to anyone who is looking to improve their mental self-talk or add a story to the “cookie jar”.
